# ReportSystem
> __*Quick Plugin Check:*__ The Plugin is now usable and functioning. This plugin is, as of right now, only recommended for servers that are open to the public as the plugin has been completely optomized for large servers.

# Installation and Support
Installing this plugin on your server is super easy to do! Just download the .phar file from poggit and plop it into your server's plugins folder. [ComingSoon]

If you wish to request features, or notify me about an issue, please, make an issue. I will be sure to read it and reply quickly and appropriately. If you are reporting an issue with the plugin, be sure to include as many details as possible and steps to reproduce the issue. If you wish to suggest something for the plugin PLEASE be sure to include "suggestions" or "requests" in the title of the issue; make sure to be descriptive when asking for a feature, so I can be sure to know how to implement it, if I choose to do so
